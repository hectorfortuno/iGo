# iGo

iGo is a Telegram bot for moving around the city of Barcelona, Catalonia, in the fastest possible way, by motor vehicle.

## Overview

>iGo project consists in a simple and user-friendly Telegram bot that allows users to get information about the driving ways
of the city of Barcelona, their live congestion and the shortest path they need to follow in order to go from their location
to the place of the city that they want.
In order to make a proper implementation of the project, two files have been created:

>`iGo.py` is the main Python module that contains all methods related to the managing of the data of the ways and congestions of
Barcelona, their insertion in graph structures, the calculation of paths between locations and the creation of beautiful and colored
maps.

>`bot.py` is the Python file containing the implementation of a Telegram Bot that uses the `iGo` module in order to offer users a simple
interface between their instructions and methods needed to get the desired and correct output.
